You are to build out a weather app prototype for this week.

The weather app will be made where you are able to do the following:

Be able to search for a location to get the weather for

Add that city to a list of favorites

On each search, I need the ability to see the following (how you achieve this is up to you)

Current weather at the time I do the search

A general 5 day forecast

The ability to see max temp and min temp of the current day.

Desktop only build

Must be designed

Must pull api from https://openweathermap.org/

Peer Review Comments: Good job on fittin the vast majority of code in the app.js, but it would have been more organized to seperate everything out. You have a couple of unused variables and coded out comments that you should probably removed. A weird bug with your code when I typed a place like tokyo it didn't show me tokyo itself, but a section of tokyo. Your website is very accurate to the figma itself. Another issue that we solved was if A city wasn't within a state it would display undefined, but we fixed that by creating and if else statement so that if it didn't contain a state it would show the city name and the country name. Good Job.
